# The-Maze-of-Waze

In this project we builded a directed weighted graph. We used the algorithms from the Previous prijrct and by theme we craet robots and fruits. the robots moves on the graph by the user choose (manual or auto) . The project was written in JAVA using intellij worksplace. First, we wrote "elements" that containing the classes : "Robot" and "Fruit" . after that we implemented "MyGameGUI" class, The user can choose between the two games. in addition, the manual game is in this class. after that we wrote "Auto_Game" class ,In this class we created an automatic game, which means that the robots can move without outside help. The displacement is done by an algorithm that causes the robot to choose an edge with a fruit on it.
At the end we wrote "KML_Logger" class , in this class create 24 kml files that can be loaded to google earth and view the game in a specific level this is only for auto game( including the robots and fruits to a KML file).

 For more explanation of the project can be found in wiki.
